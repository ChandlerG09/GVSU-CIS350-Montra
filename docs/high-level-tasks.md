# High Level Montra Tasks:
### Ideation and Baseline Requirements (COMPLETED)
Coming up with what our app is going to be, and it's most basic functionality.
###### Time spent on:
About a 2 week period where came up with the idea and then moved onto looking into Tech.
###### Person Responsible:
Josh's original idea, and we all exapnded on it and fleshed it out as a group.
### Choosing a technology (COMPLETED)
Deciding what language we are going to write the app in, weighing pros and cons.
###### Time spent on:
We spent about 6 weeks marinaiting on this phase. It was earlier in the semester so the project wasn't on the forefront of our minds so we didn't move onto the next task for awhile. We ended up choosing Flutter for availability and for a cross OS app.
###### Person Responsible:
Again, this was a task and decision that we came to as a group with us all weighing in on the pros and cons and coming to a conclusion together.
### Learn Flutter by developing the App's shell (UNCOMPLETED)
Installing Flutter workstations, understanding basic Flutter structure, and making an application shell that we can build off to implement functionality.
###### Estimated Time:
1-2 weeks until we have a very solid shell and enough Flutter understanding to implement our functionality.
###### Person to be Responsible:
This is something I think we should all again do as a group, as its best if every member is involved in this step so they are competent enough to engage with future tasks.
### Implement main reader and sound functionality (UNCOMPLETE)
Implementing the main text reader/scroller, inputing different text, reader timing, and sound ques.
###### Estimated Time:
3-8 weeks. This task may either be very difficult if it needs to be made from scratch, or require just a moderate amount of time if proper guides and resources can be found because it is a common functionality. Polishing will also require time.
###### Person to be Responsible:
Josh
### Implement customization functionality with settings and expanded bonus fucntionality (UNCOMPLETE)
Implementing main functionality customization such as image chaning, streching to bonus fucntionality like sound changing, UI changing, and implementing general and all corresponding settings.
###### Estimated Time:
3 weeks - End of available time (unlimited scope)
###### Person to be Responible:
Brandon, Chandler, Erik
### Pushing to Public (UNCOMPLETE)
Pushing the app to desired appstores, and making the app listings/submissions.
###### Estimated Time:
1 week.
###### Person Responsible:
This will be a whole team effort as we come to conclusions on app listing design, where and how to upload it, etc.
