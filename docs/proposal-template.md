# Introduction
Our project will be a mobile application that is centered around creating a easy to follow meditation guide/assistant. This app will be available for both IOS and Android. The app will essentially be a timed text reader that allows the user to enter a mantra of their choosing. 

We would also like for the app to be centered around the user and their specific needs for meditation. For this reason we hope to add customization options that can help make the user's experienced as customizable as possible. We want to include custom mantras that are read aloud on custom time intervals. We also will include a help section for the user and a user friendly settings screen that allows the user to make the changes they want for their meditation sessions. 

# Anticipated Technologies
The technologies we expect to use for this project primarily focuses on the flutter programming language. This is a hybrid language that allows for both IOS and android support without having to code them seperately in different languages. 
(What technologies are needed to build this project)

# Method/Approach
Due to the nature of our project (App development) we are likely going to use the Agile method to complete this project. 
(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline
We estimate that this project will take roughly 2-3 months to complete. *This is a guess you probably want to update this*. We would hopefully have our first prototype done a month before complete date to allow us to debug and add stuff as needed.

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems
One major problem we will likely have to overcome is learning the flutter programming language since none of us currently know the language at all. 
(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
