# Introduction
Our project will be a mobile application that is centered around creating a easy to follow meditation guide/assistant. This app will be available for both IOS and Android. The app will essentially be a timed text reader that allows the user to enter a mantra of their choosing. 

We would also like for the app to be centered around the user and their specific needs for meditation. For this reason we hope to add customization options that can help make the user's experienced as customizable as possible. We want to include custom mantras that are read aloud on custom time intervals. We also will include a help section for the user and a user friendly settings screen that allows the user to make the changes they want for their meditation sessions. 

# Anticipated Technologies
The technologies we expect to use for this project primarily focuses on the flutter programming language. This is a hybrid language that allows for both IOS and android support without having to code them seperately in different languages. Flutter wil be written in the flutter engine. 

# Method/Approach
Due to the nature of our project (App development) we are likely going to use the Agile method to complete this project. We will focus on implementing key features first and as we make progress towards the MVP we will start implementing the quality of life customizations that we want to allow the user to be able to make. 

# Estimated Timeline
We estimate that this project will take roughly 2-3 months to complete. We would hopefully have our first prototype done a month before complete date to allow us to debug and add stuff as needed. Some of our major milestones will include getting the text reader to properly work, allowing custom timing for the voice reading, adding customizable mantras, and allowing for a custom text reader reading speed. 

# Anticipated Problems
One major problem we will likely have to overcome is learning the flutter programming language since none of us currently know the language at all. We also will likely run into issues when it comes to saving a users settings after app close as this will require us to cache the information which could end up being trickier than it seems.
