# Team Montra

Our project is an mobile application that will help guide the user through a meditation session. We will allow for a text to speech reader to read the users selected or custom mantra to aid in the meditation process. We will also implemenent custimizability for the user so they can make the app their own and have it catered to their specific needs for meditation.
