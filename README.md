# Team Montra

Our project is an mobile application that will help guide the user through a meditation session. We will allow for a text to speech reader to read the users selected or custom mantra to aid in the meditation process. We will also implemenent custimizability for the user so they can make the app their own and have it catered to their specific needs for meditation.

## Prerequisites

## Run Instructions
To run our application, either go to its webpage or look at it through Flutter Flow. I reccomend the Flutter Flow option to look at it on different screen sizes. To go into test mode on Flutter FLow click the lightning bolt icon in the upper right hand corner. The whole app was not built in Flutter Flow, it is a combination of widgets built through Flow and hand built widgets.

Here is the FF page link (its a copy so feel free to mess around and edit):
